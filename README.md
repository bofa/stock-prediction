## Getting Started

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

## Development

There are two ways in which you can build and run the web app:

* Build once for (ready for ***Production***):
  * `$ npm run build`
  * Open `build/index.html` through the local webserver


* Hot reloading via webpack dev server:
  * `$ npm start`
  * Point your browser to http://localhost:3000/, page hot reloads automatically when there are changes

## Testing

To execute all unit tests, use:

```sh
npm run test
```

To run unit tests continuously during development (watch tests), use:

```sh
npm run test:watch
```

### How is Sass being processed?

We're handling it differently in DEV vs PROD.

When you run `npm start`:

 1. The sass-loader compiles Sass into CSS
 2. Webpack bundles the compiled CSS into app.js. Sounds weird, but it works!
 3. app.js contains code that loads styles into the &lt;head&gt; section of index.html via JavaScript. This is why there is no stylesheet reference in index.html. In fact, if you disable JavaScript in your browser, you'll see the styles don't load either.

The approach above supports hot reloading, which is great for development. However, it also create a flash of unstyled content on load because you have to wait for the JavaScript to parse and load styles before they're applied. So for the production build, we use a different approach:

When you run `npm run build`:

 1. The sass-loader compiles Sass into CSS
 2. The [extract-text-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin) extracts the compiled Sass into app.css
 3. buildHtml.js adds a reference to the stylesheet to the head of index.html.

### How do I deploy this?

`npm run build`. This will prepare and build the project for production use. It does the following:

- Minifies all JS and CSS
- Inline base64 URLs for images and fonts if their size is less than specified limit
- Sets NODE_ENV to `production` so that React is built in production mode
- Places the resulting built project files into `/build` directory. (This is the folder you'll expose to the world).
